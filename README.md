This is my collection of various smaller mods. 


# Goods Trade Price Redone
Changes the trade price of all the goods to depend on both maintenance of their manufactury, the input goods, and the complexity of the production chain.

There are 4 tiers of goods, representing the complexity of their production chain. Tier 1 are goods that are produced directly (e.g., Pigs, Iron, and Wood). Tier 4 are goods with 4 steps in the production chain (e.g., Advanced Weapons or Bombs).


The formula used to calculate the BasePrice of goods is as follows:

75% of:
- the cost of the building maintenance (per unit produced)
- the cost of the input ingredients (per unit produced)

then a profit margin of:
- 5% for tier 1
- 12% for tier 2
- 20% for tier 3
- 30% for tier 4
- 40% for tier 5

And, additionally there are boosts to:
- Gold Ore and Gold: 135% higher trade price (the higher Gold Ore price also results in higher Gold price) which helps boost the price of luxury products such as Jewelry and Pocket Watches.
- Goods from the Arctic also have various boosts to their price, to compensate for how difficult they are to procure.

You can also load the included spreadsheet to see all the calculations and play around with them yourself.
